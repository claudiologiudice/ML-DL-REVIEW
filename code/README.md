This folder contains code used to produce results in section 8 of the paper.
The pipeline consists of 3 scripts:

1. Preprocessing_code.R: Produces a dataset filtering out genes with standard deviation equal to zero;
2. Sex_classification.R: Implements the sex classification by means of 3 different methods (Linear model, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network);
3. Age_regression.R: Implements the age forecasting through 3 different methods (Linear model, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network);
